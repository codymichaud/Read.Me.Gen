I have been working on a project called Lyricity.
### Description of Project
Heres a little description of my project: Lyricity is a web app that was created for users to be able to view the lyrics and album art of their favorite song. Users can then favorite songs and these favorited songs will be added to the favorites bar on the left of the page. If a song cannot be found the user will be greeted with a picture of Kanye as well as a Kanye quote. If only the lyrics are found a microphone picture will take the cover arts place. If only the album art can be found the user will be greeted with the album art and a quote from Kanye..
